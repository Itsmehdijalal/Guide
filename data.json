Parents need to know that Toca Life World: Build Stories combines all the apps in the Toca Life series in one place.

The free download comes with eight locations and 39 characters already installed. There's a large variety of in-app purchases -- ranging in price from $.99 to $13.99 -- to add more locations and characters, and the shopping cart icon is prominently displayed at all times.

If you've already purchased other Toca Life apps, you can import them into Toca Life World: Build Stories for free. As with all the apps in the series, play is open-ended and involves kids moving characters and objects around different locations.

Some areas have a Record option that allows kids to record their voice as they move things around and narrate a story; for that option, the app asks for permission to access your device's microphone.
